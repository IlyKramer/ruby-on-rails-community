##What is this study group for?

The WWC Ruby on Rails (ROR) study group is a space where women can come together and help each other learn ROR. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more ROR experience to help out those that are just starting. Every study group will have the following format:

* 6:30pm - Setup and start working
* 7:00pm - Quick Introductions 
* 7:15pm - Talk (if scheduled)
* 8:15 - 8:30pm - Wrap Up 

We want a majority of the study group to be left for people to code and learn. If you are a first timer to coding or ROR we have suggested courses you can follow and encourage you to ask lots and lots of questions. Note that the first week of the month is especially for "first-timers". We will focus on providing extra support to those new to coding. 

For those who are more familiar with the language we encourage you to bring in projects that you are working on and also ask questions. I want to emphasize ASKING QUESTIONS! We want to build a community of awesome Rails devs and that requires sharing ideas and knowledge! We ask that you pleaaaaasee do not bring in or ask questions about work because they can be domain specific and not always constructive. 

Anyone should feel free to suggest talk topics or volunteer to deliver one.

##What if I'm a first timer that's never coded before?

Check out our Guide to ROR - http://bit.ly/wwcrailsguide that also contains information on how to learn about coding. Go through the recommended resources and ask lots of questions!

###Slack

The WWC community uses Slack to keep in touch and chat about all things tech. You can use Slack to ask troubleshooting questions or general questions about coding (in any language) and the tech industry. We encourge you to sign up here:  http://bitly.com/womenwhocodedcslack (and read our guide if you need more help - http://bit.ly/slackguide)

##What if I've coded before but never in Ruby or Rails?

Check out the ROR guide (http://bit.ly/wwcrailsguide) for recommended courses on Ruby and Rails. Help out others in the study group who are new to coding and may have questions about OOP, software architecture, etc. 

##What if I'm an ROR pro?

We super encourage you to attend the study group, work on a personal project or take one of the recommended courses to further your Rails skills, help others with questions they might have, consider doing a lighting talk, consider being a lead(!)

### Lightning Talk Possible Topics

* Present an app you're working on
* MVC
* Rails vs. Django (or any other framework)
* Ruby vs. any other language
* Networking/Internet Technologies

##What do leads do?

Leads are present to facilitate the study group. They help find hosts, schedule meetups, come up with curriculum, and are also available to ask questions.

##Can I be a lead?

YES! We are always looking for more leads and if you're interested in getting involved in Women Who Code in any capacity talk to one of the leads present!

###How can I contribute without being a lead?

We needs lots of help coordinating events. If you want to help out please let us know :)

##Anything Else I Need to Know?

###Contact policy at buildings that need access 

Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted. Please respect the policy, in case the location requires access to the building contact the group lead if information is provided, or drop a comment on the meetup page. We'll come and get you. 

#### All Women Welcome

This study group is intended to be exclusively open to anyone who identifies as a woman; we are transgender friendly.
